üîç Verify proxy quality with response time and anonymity scoring.
üîÑ Rapid proxy switching on Discord rate limits (429 responses).
üìä Progress tracking with visual progress bars.
üìù JSON configuration for easy source management.
üîî Webhook support for valid Nitro code notifications.
üìà Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.

Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è
Before running the tool, ensure you have:

üêç Python 3.8 or higher installed.
üì¶ pip for installing dependencies.
üåê An active internet connection.
(Optional) A Discord webhook URL for notifications.

Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Pecorio17/nitro-generator.git
cd nitro-generator


Install Dependencies:Use the provided batch script to automate dependency installation on Windows, or run the commands manually.
Batch Script for Windows
Save the following as install.bat and run it as administrator:
@echo off
echo Installing Python dependencies...
python --version >nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo Python is not installed! Please install Python 3.8 or higher.
    pause
    exit /b
)
echo Installing required packages...
pip install aiohttp colorama beautifulsoup4 tqdm requests
if %ERRORLEVEL% equ 0 (
    echo Dependencies installed successfully!
) else (
    echo Failed to install dependencies. Check your internet or pip configuration.
)
pause

Manual Installation
Run the following command to install dependencies:
pip install aiohttp colorama beautifulsoup4 tqdm requests


Verify Installation:Ensure all dependencies are installed:
pip list



Usage üöÄ

Run the Script:
python nitro_generator.py


Follow the Prompts:

Choose a proxy management option (1-5).
Specify the number of proxies to scrape (or 'all').
Set the number of verification threads (default: 30, max: 50).
Provide an output file for proxies (default: proxy.txt).
Decide whether to proceed to Nitro generation automatically.
Enter the number of Nitro codes to generate and check.
Specify the number of threads for checking.
(Optional) Provide a Discord webhook URL.


View Results:

Valid Nitro codes are saved to output/NitroCodes.txt and output/NitroCodes.json.
Logs are written to nitro_generator.log for debugging.



Configuration üîß
The script uses a config.json file to manage proxy sources and settings. The default configuration includes:

Proxy Sources: 40+ APIs and websites for proxy scraping.
User Agents: A list of browser user-agents for rotation.
Default Ports: Common ports for random IP generation (80, 8080, 3128, 8888, 1080).

To customize, edit config.json:
{
    "proxy_sources": [
        {"name": "ProxyScrape", "type": "api", "url": "https://api.proxyscrape.com/v2/?request=displayproxies&protocol=http,socks4,socks5"},
        ...
    ],
    "user_agents": [
        "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36...",
        ...
    ],
    "default_ports": [80, 8080, 3128, 8888, 1080]
}

Troubleshooting üõ°Ô∏è

No Proxies Found:

Ensure your internet connection is stable.
Check config.json for valid proxy source URLs.
Increase the number of proxies to scrape or use pre-scraped proxies.


Rate Limit Errors (429):

The script automatically switches proxies on rate limits.
If persistent, reduce the number of threads or increase proxies.


Dependency Issues:

Verify Python and pip are correctly installed.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt if you create a requirements.txt file.


Logs:

Check nitro_generator.log for detailed error messages.
